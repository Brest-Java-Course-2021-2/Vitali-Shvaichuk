# Delivery cost calculator

## Simple console application developed to calculate cost of delivery abstract good(s) of a particular weight to a particular distance.

<p>The application gets weight and distance parameters from the standard input and price parameters from a file from resources directory.
If all of input parameters are valid then the application will calculate delivery cost and will print the result into the standard output.</p>

<p>If any of the parameters is invalid then the application shall stop. The parameter becomes invalid in case it is a number less than 0 or it is not a number at all.</p>

<p>After successful cost calculating the application will suggest to enter new parameters to calculate new delivery cost. The application will behave the same until user enters an invalid parameter (this is the only way to stop the application).</p>
